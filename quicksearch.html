"},"index.html":{"id":"index.html","title":"Index","body":" snoowrap Classes snoowrapRedditContentReplyableContentVoteableContentCommentRedditUserSubmissionLiveThreadPrivateMessageSubredditMultiRedditWikiPageListing snoowrap A simple Node.js wrapper for the reddit API. (Documentation) Featuressnoowrap supports every API endpoint, and provides a simple interface to access each of them. The method to get a user profile is just get_user(), and the method to upvote something is just upvote(). There's no need to look up REST endpoints or deal with low-level HTTP requests. If you've used PRAW, you'll probably find a lot of snoowrap's syntax to be familiar. However, aside from being written in a different language, there are a few important differences: Unlike PRAW, snoowrap is non-blocking; all API calls are async and return bluebird Promises. This means that you can handle asynchronous events however you want, and you can use snoowrap as part of a larger process without it holding everything back. Each snoowrap object is completely independent. If you want, you can have scripts from separate accounts make requests at the same time. snoowrap's objects are structured to keep the syntax as simple as possible. So the following expression: r.get_submission('2np694').body...will return a Promise. So will this one: r.get_submission('2np694').author.name // --&gt; returns a Promise for the string 'DO_U_EVN_SPAGHETTI' // (this submission's author's name)The above will return a Promise for the author's name, without having to deal with callback hell or .then statements. You can chain multiple API calls together: r.get_submission('2np694').subreddit.get_moderators()[0].name // --&gt; returns a Promise for the string 'krispykrackers' // (this submission's subreddit's first mod's name)...or chain actions together with fluent syntax: r.get_subreddit('snoowrap') .submit_selfpost({title: 'Discussion Thread', text: 'Hello! This is a thread'}) .sticky() .distinguish() .ignore_reports() .assign_flair({text: 'Exciting Flair Text', css_class: 'modpost'})snoowrap handles all API interactions such as authentication, ratelimiting, error correction, and HTTP requests under the hood. That way, you can write less boilerplate code and focus more on doing what you actually want to do. After you provide a token once, snoowrap will refresh it on its own from then on -- you won't have to worry about authentication again. snoowrap uses lazy objects, so it never fetches more than it needs to. snoowrap has built-in ratelimit protection. If you hit reddit's ratelimit, you can choose to queue the request, and then run it after the current ratelimit period runs out. That way you won't lose a request if you go a bit too fast. snoowrap will retry its request a few times if reddit returns an error due to its servers being overloaded. For more examples of what can be done with snoowrap, take a look at the documentation or the test file. Simple example file'use strict'; const snoowrap = require('snoowrap'); /* Create a new snoowrap requester. If you're uncomfortable storing confidential info in your file, one solution is to simply store it in a json file and require() it. For more information on how to get valid credentials, see here: https://github.com/not-an-aardvark/reddit-oauth-helper */ const r = new snoowrap({ client_id: 'put your client id here', client_secret: 'put your client secret here', refresh_token: 'put your refresh token here' }); /* That's the entire setup process, now you can just make requests. I would recommend including async functions in your project by using babel.js (or some equivalent), but this example file uses vanilla Promises for simplicity. */ // Submitting a link to a subreddit r.get_subreddit('gifs').submit_link({ title: 'Mt. Cameramanjaro', url: 'https://i.imgur.com/n5iOc72.gifv' }); // Printing a list of the titles on the front page r.get_hot().map(post =&gt; post.title).then(console.log); // Replying to comments that match certain criteria r.get_new_comments().fetch_until(500).forEach(comment =&gt; { if (comment.body === 'ayy') { comment.reply('lmao'); // (look at me I'm so original) } }); // Automating moderation tasks r.get_subreddit('some_subreddit_name').get_modqueue({limit: 100}).filter(/some-removal-condition/.test).forEach(flaggedItem =&gt; { flaggedItem.remove(); flaggedItem.subreddit.ban_user(flaggedItem.author); // (Probably overkill here, but that's none of my business and pretty much any functionality is there if you want it) }); // Automatically creating a stickied thread for a moderated subreddit r.get_subreddit('some_subreddit_name') .create_selfpost({title: 'Daily thread', text: 'Discuss things here'}) .sticky() .distinguish() .approve() .assign_flair({text: 'Daily Thread flair text', css_class: 'daily-thread'}) .reply('This is a comment that appears on that daily thread'); // etc. etc. // Printing the content of a wiki page r.get_subreddit('AskReddit').get_wiki_page('bestof').content_md.then(console.log); Live threadsReddit's live threads are different from most other content, in that messages are distributed through websockets instead of a RESTful API. snoowrap fully supports this protocol under the hood, and it represents the content stream as an EventEmitter. For example, the following code will stream all livethread updates to the console as they appear: r.get_livethread('whrdxo8dg9n0').stream.on('update', console.log);For more information, see snoowrap's LiveThread documentation page. Important note regarding ES6snoowrap uses the Proxy object introduced in ES6. Since this is not yet included in Node by default, you will need to run your project with the --harmony-proxies runtime flag, e.g. node --harmony-proxies yourProject.js. With regard to running code in browsers, as of March 2016 the only browsers that support Proxies are Chrome 49+, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, and Opera. If you can't use that node flag for some reason, or your code is running in a non-supporting browser, snoowrap will still function. However, method chaining as described above won't work, so your syntax will need to be a bit heavier. For example: // This works when run with node's --harmony-proxies flag, or with a browser that supports Proxies. // However, it fails if Proxies are not available. r.get_submission('47v7tm').comments[0].upvote(); // ---------- // This is equivalent and works on all platforms, but the syntax isn't as nice. // Note: .get() and .call() are the standard bluebird utility methods. r.get_submission('47v7tm').fetch().get('comments').get(0).call('upvote'); To include in a project npm install snoowrap --save var snoowrap = require('snoowrap'); To build/run the tests independently git clone https://github.com/not-an-aardvark/snoowrap.git cd snoowrap npm install npm test × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.4.0 using the DocStrap template. "},"snoowrap.html":{"id":"snoowrap.html","title":"Class: snoowrap","body":" snoowrap Classes snoowrapRedditContentReplyableContentVoteableContentCommentRedditUserSubmissionLiveThreadPrivateMessageSubredditMultiRedditWikiPageListing Class: snoowrap snoowrap The class for a snoowrap requester new snoowrap($0) Parameters: Name Type Description $0 object An Object containing credentials. This should have the properties (a) user_agent, client_id, client_secret, and refresh_token, or (b) user_agent and access_token. Properties Name Type Argument Description user_agent string A unique description of what your app does client_id string &lt;optional&gt; The client ID of your app (assigned by reddit) client_secret string &lt;optional&gt; The client secret of your app (assigned by reddit) refresh_token string &lt;optional&gt; A refresh token for your app. You will need to get this from reddit beforehand. A script to automatically generate refresh tokens for you can be found here. access_token string &lt;optional&gt; An access token for your app. If this is provided, then the client ID/client secret/refresh token are not required. Note that all access tokens expire one hour after being generated; if you want to retain access for longer than that, provide the other credentials instead. Methods config(options) Retrieves or modifies the configuration options for this requester. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description options object &lt;optional&gt; A map of {[config property name]: value}. Note that any omitted config properties will simply retain whatever value they had previously (In other words, if you only want to change one property, you only need to put that one property in this parameter. To get the current configuration without modifying anything, simply omit this parameter.) Properties Name Type Argument Default Description endpoint_domain string &lt;optional&gt; 'reddit.com' The endpoint where requests should be sent request_delay string &lt;optional&gt; 0 A minimum delay, in milliseconds, to enforce between API calls. If multiple api calls are requested during this timespan, they will be queued and sent one at a time. Setting this to more than 1 will ensure that reddit's ratelimit is never reached, but it will make things run slower than necessary if only a few requests are being sent. If this is set to zero, snoowrap will not enforce any delay between individual requests. However, it will still refuse to continue if reddit's enforced ratelimit (600 requests per 10 minutes) is exceeded. continue_after_ratelimit_error string &lt;optional&gt; false Determines whether snoowrap should queue API calls if reddit's ratelimit is exceeded. If set to true when the ratelimit is exceeded, snoowrap will queue all further requests, and will attempt to send them again after the current ratelimit period expires (which happens every 10 minutes). If set to false, snoowrap will simply throw an error when reddit's ratelimit is exceeded. retry_error_codes Array.&lt;Number&gt; &lt;optional&gt; [502, 503, 504, 522] If reddit responds to a request with one of these error codes, snoowrap will retry the request, up to a maximum of options.max_retry_attempts requests in total. (These errors usually indicate that there was an temporary issue on reddit's end, and retrying the request has a decent chance of success.) This behavior can be disabled by simply setting this property to an empty array. max_retry_attempts number &lt;optional&gt; 3 See retry_error_codes. suppress_warnings boolean &lt;optional&gt; false snoowrap may occasionally log relevant warnings, such as deprecation notices, to the console. These can be disabled by setting this to true. Returns: An updated Object containing all of the configuration values Type object revoke_access_token() Invalidates the current access token. Note: This can only be used if the current requester was supplied with a client_id and client_secret. If the current requester was supplied with a refresh token, it will automatically create a new access token if any more requests are made after this one. Returns: A Promise that fulfills when this request is complete Type Promise revoke_refresh_token() Invalidates the current refresh token. Note: This can only be used if the current requester was supplied with a client_id and client_secret. All access tokens generated by this refresh token will also be invalidated. This effectively de-authenticates the requester and prevents it from making any more valid requests. This should only be used in a few cases, e.g. if this token has been accidentally leaked to a third party.

"},"Listing.html":{"id":"Listing.html","title":"Class: Listing","body":" snoowrap Classes snoowrapRedditContentReplyableContentVoteableContentCommentRedditUserSubmissionLiveThreadPrivateMessageSubredditMultiRedditWikiPageListing Class: Listing Listing A class representing a list of content. This is a subclass of the native Array object, so it has all the properties of an Array (length, forEach, etc.) in addition to some added methods. At any given time, each Listing has fetched a specific number of items, and that number will be its length. The Listing can be extended by using the #fetch_more(), #fetch_until, and #fetch_all() functions. Most methods that return Listings will also accept limit, after, before, show, and count properties. new Listing() Extends Array Members is_finished This is a getter that is true if there are no more items left to fetch, and false otherwise. Methods fetch_more(amount) Fetches some more items and adds them to this Listing. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description amount number &lt;optional&gt; The number of items to fetch. If this is not defined, one more &quot;batch&quot; of items is fetched; the size of a batch depends on the type of Listing this is, as well as the requester's reddit preferences. Returns: An updated version of this listing with amount items added on. Type Promise fetch_all() Fetches all of the items in this Listing, only stopping when there are none left. Returns: The updated version of this Listing. Keep in mind that this method has the potential to exhaust your ratelimit quickly if the Listing doesn't have a clear end (e.g. with posts on the front page), so use it with discretion. Type Promise fetch_until($0) Fetches items until a given length is reached. Parameters: Name Type Description $0 object Properties Name Type Description length number The maximum length that the Listing should have after completion. The length might end up being less than this if the true number of available items in the Listing is less than $0.length. For example, this can't fetch 200 comments on a Submission that only has 100 comments in total.
